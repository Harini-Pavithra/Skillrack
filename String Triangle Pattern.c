Explanation: The last 2 characters of the first word in S is "sk". 
The first line of the output must contain one word. So, "sk" is printed. 
The last 2 characters of the second and third word are "py" and "rd". 
The second line of the output must contain two words separated by space(s). 
So, "py" and "rd" printed. The last 2 characters of the fourth and fifth word are "er" and "ng". 
The third line of the output must contain three words separated by space(s). But here, there are two words only.
So, "er" and "ng" is printed. Then, for the third word "**" is printed.
